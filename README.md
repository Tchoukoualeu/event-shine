# Event App
This simple app takes and validates the input information [here](https://tchoukoualeu.github.io/event-shine/), and saves them to mongoDB.

## Backend
Saving and retrieving data is hoocked to a nodejs-MongoDB backend app hosted on `Glitch.com`:

To fetch all the events saved in the DB, make a GET request to https://event-backend-nodejs.glitch.me/list or simply open the link on your browser. (*Could take few minutes to load, glitch.com puts unused apps to sleep*)

The backend Front page can be found here:
- [Backend Glitch](https://event-backend-nodejs.glitch.me/) (*Could take few minutes to load, glitch.com puts unused apps to sleep*)
- [Backend Repository](https://github.com/Tchoukoualeu/event-app-backend)
